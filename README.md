File names correspond to "Using ChatGPT as a tool for training non-programmers to generate genomic sequence analysis code" Table 2: Genomic Sequencing Data Analysis Tasks Utilizing ChatGPT-Generated Python Scripts. Task: Name of daily assignment (DA) or task (T) that was assigned in class by the instructor. Goal: Describes what the Python script should achieve. ChatGPT Prompt: Exact verbiage used in the prompt given to ChatGPT allowing it to generate the desired code. Python Script Identifier: The arbitrary ID (as found in GitHub) given to each code generated that achieved the desired goal but was generated by inputting different student verbiage. P denotes the exact script generated using the prompt written in the table. S denotes other scripts that also achieved the desired goal but were generated by different students inputting their own unique verbiage. Scripts can be accessed through GitHub using the Python Script Identifier.
